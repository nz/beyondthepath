Hello world. A friend recently described blogging to me thus:

> Blogging is a great way to process ideas and clarify your thinking.
> Sometimes, as a side bonus, someone else will read it.

In that spirit, here are some thoughts I've been processing. If you find yourself processing thoughts of your own, I welcome a conversation via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nz_) or [email](mailto:nick@zadrozny.com).
